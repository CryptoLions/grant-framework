## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** Jungle Testnet 1 year of Maintenance

- **Brief Description:** This application seeks a Maintenance Grant for the ongoing maintenance of the Jungle Testnet on CryptoLions's side and rewards for other BPs. The grant is specifically for one year of maintenance without significant frontend development of new features. The requested grant covers launching a new "Savanna" branch of the testnet, DevOps support, support management, social media management, hardware for "Jungle" and "Savanna" branches, and rewards for other BPs. Minor improvements to the existing Jungle Monitor (https://monitor4.jungletestnet.io/) are possible. We prefer to receive grant parts on a monthly basis according to 12 milestones. “Savanna” is a “copy” of the EOS Mainnet, a stagenet to run long-term tests, it’s open to all, including beginners; on the other hand, “Jungle” serves as a less stable version, designed for experimental purposes, and welcomes more experienced developers, BPs, and testers.

- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The Jungle Testnet was initiated by CryptoLions and has served as a sandbox for many dev teams and Block Producers since the birth of EOS. It played a cornerstone role in the EOS launch and now as the network matures and grows it provides a reliable test environment for EOS-based dapps. Many critical errors have been found and fixed in Jungle before they could make their way to the mainnet, and many EOS dapps and features were developed and tested there.

- **Reason for Interest:** CryptoLions Team, is an EOS block-producer and developer from the EOS beginning. In 2018 we launched the initial version of Jungle Testnet, one of the first testnets on EOS, and made it available to the community. We constantly contribute our effort, and as a result the 4th version of the Jungle was released recently. We are glad to have a lot of supporters who join our path. We hope you see the value of what we are doing and consider the possibility of giving us a Maintenance Grant.

### Project Details

The Jungle Testnet is a testnet for the EOS blockchain on Antelope software.

**An overview of the technology stack to be used**

Antelope software, Shell script, C++, JavaScript, HTML.

**Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed**

Will be provided basic documentation that covers key workflows.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**

Jungle Testnet fits EOS Ecosystem, since it's testnet for EOS Mainnet. The concept of having multiple "branches" of Jungle blockchains can help to separate daily tests made by dapp developers from stress tests by block producers.

**Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?**

EOS dapp developers and testers.

**What need(s) does your project meet?**

Testing EOS dapps and EOS blockchain.

**Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?**

We are not aware of other projects that offer the concept of testnet "branches".

### Team Experience

The CryptoLions team has experience and expertise in the blockchain industry. We have successfully launched and maintained block production nodes for various chains on the Antelope (EOSIO) software, including EOS. Additionally, we have developed and launched several own dapps, such as MSIG.app, the NFT game "Kolobok Adventures", NFT MarketPlace, NFT Tools, Redemption Bank and others.

We have collaborated with industry leaders on several EOS blockchain projects and provided consultation and code-review for various EOS and Antelope projects. The CryptoLions team consists of members with extensive experience across multiple fields and technologies. Since 2018, we have been active in the EOS and Antelope (EOSIO) communities, continuously working to improve our experience and the blockchain industry in general.

Moreover, our team takes pride in developing the first NFT standard for EOS, SimpleAsset and maintain Jungle Testnet during years, the testnet where ENF perform its tests https://medium.com/eos-network-foundation/eos-evm-launches-on-jungle-testnet-with-full-ethereum-and-rpc-compatibility-f741485b5577.

The CryptoLions team played a key role in identifying a critical issue on the EOS Mainnet just a few days before its launch. Specifically, the Jungle Testnet had crashed instead of the EOS Mainnet. This incident was documented by the EOS Metal team in their blog (https://medium.com/coinmonks/thats-how-we-broke-jungle-testnet-twice-in-a-row-eleven-days-before-1-0-eosio-release-ef996495df). After the EOS launch, there were 2-3 occasions when the Jungle Testnet was disrupted and crashed instead of the EOS Mainnet (for example canceled deferred transactions, found by the WeCan team). During these incidents, the CryptoLions team was actively involved in testing, communication and investigating the causes of the problems.
